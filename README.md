# NexusCore: AI-Powered Dataset Generation Platform


> Transform natural language into structured datasets in seconds

-----

## 💡 Inspiration

The Data Problem No One Discusses: Most professionals spend \>50% of their time finding correct data.

**Why?**

  * 📄 Data trapped in disorganized PDFs
  * 🌍 Missing information in public datasets
  * 🧪 Coding skills needed for synthetic data

**NexusCore transforms** "I can't find the right data" into **"I made it in 60 seconds."**
