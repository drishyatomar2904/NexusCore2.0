# NexusCore: AI-Powered Dataset Generation Platform


> Transform natural language into structured datasets in seconds

-----

## 💡 Inspiration

The Data Problem No One Discusses: Most professionals spend \>50% of their time finding correct data.

**Why?**

  * 📄 Data trapped in disorganized PDFs
  * 🌍 Missing information in public datasets
  * 🧪 Coding skills needed for synthetic data

**NexusCore transforms** "I can't find the right data" into **"I made it in 60 seconds."**

## 🛠 Built With

A straightforward but creative tech stack powers **NexusCore**.  With its seamless drag-and-drop interface and live preview, the frontend—which was constructed with **HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript** ,makes dataset generation quick and easy.  We built a **session-based processing pipeline** on the **backend** using **Flask** and **Python** to guarantee **isolated** and **responsive task execution**.  **Groq** and **LLaMA3-70B** are **integrated by the AI engine**, which uses **prompt chaining techniques** to create **structured CSV files** **dynamically based on user input**.  We handled documents by **accurately extracting text and tables** from **complex PDFs** using **PyPDF2** and **custom layout-aware logic**.
